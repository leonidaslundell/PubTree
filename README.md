# PubTree

Experimenting with visualizing the results of PubMed querries through a network structure. 

By providing a PMID from an article, you can retrieve articles citing, articles cited, and some simple clustering and summarization of authorshit, type of article, year published, and citations. Clicking on any of the cited or citing articles allows you to explore its relationships. Finally you can visualize and download the summary of your querries to more carefully read the articles you have identified.
